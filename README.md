# Kubernetes Arm First

This is a extension for Kubernetes that extends the default scheduler to support architecture-based prioritization and/or filtering for pod placement.

The intent is to allow the cluster administrator to set policies to control which nodes a pod should be placed on depending on the availability of ARM images for the pod.
